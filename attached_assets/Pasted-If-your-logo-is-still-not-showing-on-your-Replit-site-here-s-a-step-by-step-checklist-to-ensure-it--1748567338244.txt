If your logo is still not showing on your Replit site, here’s a step-by-step checklist to ensure it displays correctly:

---

## 1. **Upload the Logo File Properly**

- In the Replit file sidebar, click the three dots (`...`) and select **Upload File**.
- Choose your logo image (e.g., `logo.png`).
- Make sure the file appears in your project’s root directory.

---

## 2. **Reference the Logo Correctly in Your HTML**

- Use a relative path in your `` tag, matching the file name exactly (case-sensitive):

```html

```

- Place this tag in your HTML where you want the logo to appear (for example, inside your header).

---

## 3. **Check for Typos and File Name Issues**

- The file name in your code must match the uploaded file exactly (e.g., `logo.png` is different from `Logo.PNG`).
- Avoid spaces or special characters in the file name.

---

## 4. **Do Not Use External Image Links Unless CORS Allows**

- If you use an external image URL, it may not load due to CORS or hotlink protection[1].
- Always prefer uploading the image directly to your Replit project.

---

## 5. **Clear Browser Cache and Refresh**

- Sometimes, browsers cache old images or file lists.
- Try a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).
- If still not visible, clear your browser cache.

---

## 6. **Check the Browser Console for Errors**

- Open DevTools (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console/Network).
- Look for 404 errors (file not found) or CORS errors.
- If you see a 404, double-check the file name and path.

---

## 7. **Example: Minimal Working Setup**

**Project Structure:**
```
- index.html
- style.css
- logo.png
```

**index.html:**
```html

## 8. **If the Logo Still Doesn’t Show**

- Try renaming the logo file (e.g., `ai-logo.png`), re-upload, and update the `` reference.
- Make sure you’re not referencing a path like `/logo.png` (absolute) unless your server root is set up that way; use `logo.png` (relative).

---

## 9. **Favicon (Optional)**

If you want the logo as a favicon:
```html

```

---

**Summary:**  
Upload your logo to your Replit project, use the exact file name in your `` tag, and check for typos or errors in the browser console. Avoid using external image links due to CORS issues[1][4][5][6]. This will ensure your logo displays correctly on your site.
